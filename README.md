### Hello there!

My name is Manaar Salama, and I'm a third year at Berkeley studying Data Science. 

Currently, I'm working on gaining more experience by working on personal data science projects and
learning more about using GitHub! You can see more of what I'm doing and have done at my [personal GitHub Pages site](https://mgsalama.github.io)!

Feel free to reach out for anything at all. Take care!
