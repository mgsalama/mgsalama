<h1 align="center">Hello there!</h1>

<p>My name is Manaar Salama, and I'm a third year at UC Berkeley studying Data Science.</p>

<p>Currently, I'm working on gaining more experience through personal data science projects and learning more about using GitHub. You can see more of what I'm doing and have done on my <a href= "https://mgsalama.github.io">personal GitHub Pages site</a>!</p>

<p>Feel free to reach out for anything at all. Take care!</p>
