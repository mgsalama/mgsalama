### Hello there!

My name is Manaar Salama, and I'm a third year at UC Berkeley studying Data Science. 

Currently, I'm working on gaining more experience through personal data science projects and learning more about using GitHub. You can see more of what I'm doing and have done on my [personal GitHub Pages site](https://mgsalama.github.io)!

Feel free to reach out for anything at all. Take care!
